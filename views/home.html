            <p>Mote is a web-based calendar and planner application designed specifically to help students manage their academic workload with ease. Unlike generic calendar tools, Mote allows students to organize all their course deadlines such as assignments, quizzes, and exams in one centralized platform. With an intuitive interface, students can quickly add deadlines and view their schedule by day, week, or month. By streamlining the process of tracking academic responsibilities, Mote reduces the risk of missed deadlines and supports better time management, helping students stay focused and organized throughout the school term.</p>
